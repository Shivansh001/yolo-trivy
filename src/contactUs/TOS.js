        <h3 class="semi-bold">4. Membership and Account.</h3>
        <p>In consideration of your use of the
        Site, you represent that you are of legal age to form a binding contract
        and are not a person barred from receiving services under the laws of
        the United States or other applicable jurisdiction and will only use
        the Site for legitimate purposes.  You also agree to provide true,
        accurate, current and complete information about yourself when you apply
        for YOLOCard Membership. If you provide any information that
        is untrue, inaccurate, not current or incomplete (or becomes untrue,
        inaccurate, not current or incomplete), or YOLOCard has reasonable
        grounds to suspect that such information is untrue, inaccurate, not
        current or incomplete, YOLOCard has the right to suspend or terminate
        your account and refuse any and all current or future use of the Site
        (or any portion thereof).  If you use the Site, you are responsible
        for maintaining the confidentiality of your account and password, and
        for restricting access to your computer.  You agree to accept responsibility
        for all activities that occur under your account or password.
        Because of this, we strongly recommend that you exit from your account
        at the end of each session.  You agree to notify YOLOCard
        immediately of any unauthorized use of your account or any other breach
        of security.  YOLOCard reserves the right to refuse Membership or
        service, terminate Membership, or remove or edit content in its sole discretion.
        Notwithstanding the above, we retain the right at our sole discretion
        to deny access to anyone to the Site and the Services we offer and Membership
        at any time and for any reason, including, but not limited to, for violation
        of the TOS or Privacy Policy.  You agree that you will use your YOLOCard
        Membership card for the purposes that it was issued. </p>
  			<br/>

        <h3 class="semi-bold">5. Membership Fee and Billing.</h3>
        <p>If your Membership application is approved, you will be charged based on the terms that you agreed to on your Membership application. You will only be charged if your application is approved. Your annual Membership fee may be subject to taxation in accordance with applicable federal or state law. The annual Membership fee does not include applicable taxes. We may change the Membership fee at any time, but changes will apply only to new and renewal Memberships. The Membership fee is not refundable. Prepaid cards will not be accepted as a valid payment method and will be declined.</p>
  			<br/>

        <h3 class="semi-bold">6. Term; Continuous Membership; Billing.</h3>
        <p>The initial term of a Membership shall
        commence on the date it is purchased and continue until one year from
        the date in which the Membership was purchased. Each Membership will automatically renew (therein referred to as a "Renewal Membership") each year for additional one-year periods (referred to as "Continuous Membership") unless (i) you notify Member Services in writing, of your decision to cancel your Membership within 30 days of your renewal date; or (ii) we terminate your Membership. </p>
  			<br/>

        <p>Renewal Membership fees will be billed
        annually and automatically to the credit card we currently have on file,
        in the amount of the then current Membership fee on or around the
        day in which your current Membership or Renewal Membership
        term expires. If we attempt to charge the credit card on file in the amount
        of your renewal and the transaction fails, we may reattempt the charge for
        up to 60 days from that date unless you notify YOLOCard of your decision to cancel your Membership.</p>
  			<br/>

        <h3 class="semi-bold">7. Cancellation, Termination, and Changes to Service.</h3>
        <p>(a) You have the right to cancel your
        Membership at any time.  Because of the nature of our service,
        no refunds will be available. </p>
  			<br/>

        <p>(b) YOLOCard reserves the right to
        cancel or suspend, including any associated accounts, without notice, for any reason in
        our sole discretion, including without limitation our belief that continued
        use of such Membership would violate any provisions of this TOS, applicable
        law, or otherwise be harmful to our interests.  If YOLOCard cancels
        your Membership, YOLOCard may, at its sole discretion, refund the balance of
        the annual Membership fee on a time apportionment basis.
        </p>
  			<br/>

        <p>

            (c) We may terminate any or all of the benefits available to Members at any time with or without notice.
            No refunds will be available.

        </p>
  			<br/>

        <p>

            (d) Upon cancellation of Membership, you are relinquishing your current annual Membership rate and understand you will not be able to rejoin at a later time at that rate.  You will also be relinquishing any FCPoints that were accrued during your Membership term, as well as any current or ongoing benefits you were enrolled in as a Member.


        </p>
  			<br/>

        <h3 class="semi-bold">8. Membership Benefits and Spouse/Significant Other Privileges</h3>
        <p>(a)  As a Member of YOLOCard, you're
        entitled to the benefits that pertain to your particular Membership type. Certain Membership types and/or complimentary periods of Membership may exclude certain benefits.</p>
  			<br/>

        <p>(b) YOLOCard has the right to add,
        modify or eliminate any benefit or service at any time at our discretion.
        YOLOCard does not guarantee the availability of any of its benefits
        and they are all subject to change at any time without notice.
          </p>
  			<br/>

        <p>
        (c) Any Spouse or Significant Other Membership that is part of a Membership Account shall be automatically terminated when that Membership account to which it is connected ends.
          </p>
  			<br/>

        <p>
          (d) All accounts, including Spouse or Significant Other accounts, require an active credit card on file in order to have access to the website and benefits of Membership. Credit cards on Spouse or Significant Other accounts will only be used if the billing information associated with the account to which it is connected becomes invalid.

        <h3 class="semi-bold">18. Modification and Notification of
        Changes.</h3>
  			<br/>

        <p>YOLOCard reserves the right to
        make changes to the Site and Membership Agreement, related policies
        and agreements, this TOS and the Privacy Policy at any time.  If YOLOCard makes a material modification to this TOS, it will notify you by:</p>
  			<br/>

        <p>(i) sending an email to the address
        associated with your account.  YOLOCard is not responsible for
        your failure to receive an email due to the actions of your ISP or any
        email filtering service; therefore, you should add <a href="https://YOLOcard.com" target="_blank">YOLOcard.com</a>
        to the list of domains approved to send you email (commonly known as
        your "whitelist"); and (ii) displaying a prominent announcement
        above the text of this TOS or the Privacy Policy, as appropriate, for
        thirty (30) days, with (i) and (ii) being deemed sufficient notification,
        of such changes.  After notice of a modification to the TOS or
        the Privacy Policy has been posted for 30 days, the notice will be removed
        and a brief description of the modification and the date that it went
        into effect will be placed in the Historical Modifications section at
        the end of the TOS and Privacy Policy.  If you have not used the Site
        for more than 30 days, you should check these two sections for any modifications
        to the TOS or Privacy Policy prior to any further use of the Site.
        Should you wish to terminate your account due to a modification to the
        TOS or the Privacy Policy, you may do so by sending an email with the
        subject line "Termination" to the following email address:
        <a href="mailto:hello@trivy.co" target="_blank">hello@trivy.co</a>.  If you choose to continue using the Site,
        you agree that by doing so you will be deemed to accept the new TOS
        or Privacy Policy, as relevant. </p>

        property of a third party.  If you believe that your work has been copied
        in a way that constitutes copyright infringement, or your intellectual
        property rights have been otherwise violated, please provide YOLOCard‘s Copyright Agent the following information:</p>
  			<br/>

        <p>(i) an electronic or physical signature
        of the person authorized to act on behalf of the owner of the copyright
        or other intellectual property interest; (ii) a description of the copyrighted
        work or other intellectual property that you claim has been infringed;
        (iii) a description of where the material that you claim is infringing
        is located on the Site; (iv) your address, telephone number, and email
        address; (v) a statement by you that you have a good faith belief that

        or the law; or (vi) a statement by you, made under penalty of perjury,
        that the above information in your notice is accurate and that you are
        the copyright or intellectual property owner or authorized to act on
        the copyright or intellectual property owner's behalf.</p>

        <h3 class="semi-bold">21. Survival of Terms After Agreement
        Ends.</h3>
  			<br/>

        <p>Notwithstanding any other provisions
        of this TOS, or any general legal principles to the contrary, any provision
        of this TOS that imposes or contemplates continuing obligations on a
        party will survive the expiration or termination of this TOS.
        </p>
  			<br/>

        <h3 class="semi-bold">22. General.</h3>
        <p>If any of these conditions are deemed
        invalid, void, or for any reason unenforceable, the parties agree that
        the court should endeavor to give effect to the parties’ intentions
        as reflected in the provision, and the unenforceable condition shall
        be deemed severable and shall not affect the validity and enforceability
        of any remaining condition.  Headings are for reference purposes only
        and do not limit the scope or extent of such section. This TOS and the
        relationship between you and YOLOCard will be governed by the laws
        of the State of New York without regard to its conflict of law provisions.
        You and YOLOCard agree to submit to the personal jurisdiction of
        the federal and state courts located in the State of New York with respect
        to any legal proceedings that may arise in connection with this TOS.
        The failure of YOLOCard to act with respect to a breach by you
        or others does not waive its right to act with respect to subsequent
        or similar breaches.  YOLOCard does not guarantee it will
        take action against all breaches of this TOS.  Except as otherwise
        expressly provided in this TOS, there shall be no third-party beneficiaries
        to this TOS.  This TOS constitutes the entire agreement between you
        and YOLOCard and governs your use of the Site, superseding any
        prior agreements between you and YOLOCard with respect to the Site.
         </p>
  			<br/>

        <p>Except for claims for injunctive or
        equitable relief or claims regarding intellectual property rights (which may
        be brought in any competent court without the posting of a bond), any dispute
        arising under these Terms of Service and Membership Agreement shall be finally
        settled in accordance with the Comprehensive Arbitration Rules of the Judicial
        Arbitration and Mediation Service, Inc. (“JAMS”) by three arbitrators appointed
        in accordance with such Rules. The arbitration shall take place in Austin,
        Texas, in the English language and the arbitral decision may be enforced in any
        court. The prevailing party in any action or proceeding to enforce this Agreement
        shall be entitled to costs and attorneys’ fees. If any part of these Terms of
        Service and Membership Agreement is held invalid or unenforceable, that part will
        be construed to reflect the parties’ original intent, and the remaining portions
        will remain in full force and effect. A waiver by either party of any term or
        condition of this Agreement or any breach thereof, in any one instance, will not
        waive such term or condition or any subsequent breach thereof. You may assign your
        rights under this Agreement to any party that consents to, and agrees to be bound
        by, its terms and conditions; YOLOCard may assign its rights under this Agreement
        without condition. This Agreement will be binding upon and will inure to the benefit
        of the parties, their successors and permitted assigns.</p>
